# Calculator
Personal calculator using HTML, CSS &amp; JS. 

I will be updating this calculator to use more enhanced features in the near future. The operations are currently being performed by the JS eval() function which is not the best option. As such, I will implement the logic for the basic mathematical operations and adding additional cases. Please feel free to copy and modify this code for your needs.
